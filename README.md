# Predictive-Data-Processing


Overview
This repository contains the code for a powerful prediction system that employs three robust data modeling algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Boosting. The system is designed to assist users in predicting values based on input data.

Features
Data Modeling Algorithms: I have implemented Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Boosting algorithms to provide accurate and reliable rent predictions.

User-Friendly Interface: My system is designed with user-friendliness in mind. Users can easily input their data and obtain  predictions.

Result Export Options: I offer convenient options to save prediction results in various formats, including Excel and CSV. Additionally, users can store results in databases such as SQL Server and MongoDB.

Design Patterns: My codebase is structured using design patterns, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and code quality.
